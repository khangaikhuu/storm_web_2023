        The Cottage Garden originated in <span>England</span> and its history can be traced back for centuries, 
        although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a
        reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <span>English estate Gardens</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with 
        and emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.
